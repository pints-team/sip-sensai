= How to recreate the results in Aidan's paper =

== Logistic ==

1. Using matlab, open the file

    ..hobo/thirdparty/SENSAI_MuPad/Examples/ODE_examples/Logistic/Logistic.mn
   
   And set the correct paths at the top (set the last one to wherever you'd like
    the SIP stuff to go)
    
   From the menu, select
   
    Notebook > Evaluate all
    
   to generate "input" .m files

2. In matlab, browse to

    ...hobo/thirdparty/SENSAI_MuPad
    
   And generate further m files using:
   
    run_MuPAD('Examples/ODE_examples/Logistic')
    
   Ignore the warning

=== Figure 1 ===

3. After generating the files, run

    run_gtype('Examples/ODE_examples/Logistic', 0)
    
   Figures 15200, 15300 and 15301 are the ones in the paper



== Hodgkin-Huxley 1, Symbolic-differentiation based stuff ==


=== Figure 4 ===

1. Do the same as for Logistic, but with HodgkinHuxley/HodgkinHuxley.mn

   Figures 15200, 15300 and 15301 are the ones in the paper, but with different
   scalings for the x-axis (0-12). The y-axis of the black dotted graph should
   also be set to approx. -84, 34


=== Remaining figures ===

1. Generate input m files as before using MuPAD and Evaluate all

2. Now MANUALLY MODIFY the generated file 

    ..hobo/thirdparty/SENSAI_MuPad/Examples/ODE_examples/HodgkinHuxley/user_inputs.m

   and change

    qtype = 1;
    stype = 3;
    
   to

    qtype = 0;
    stype = 1;
    
3. Generate m-files using

    run_MuPAD('Examples/ODE_examples/Logistic')
    
   Ignore the warning

4. Check user_SIP.m and see if the grid size (ngrid) is set to something small

    ngrid = [10 10 10]
   
5. Now run an analysis using

    run_gtype('Examples/ODE_examples/HodgkinHuxley', 15)
    
   This should generate a bunch of files in the location specified way back in
   the MuPAD file.
   
6. Analyse the results by changing matlab's working directory to

    ..hobo/thirdparty/SIP
    
   and running
   
    SIP_SENSAI('/home/michael/sensai', '/home/michael/sensai', 'HodgkinHuxley','HH-SpringBreak', 2, 2)
   
   where 'home/michael/sensai' should be whatever you specified as OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
   way back in the MuPAD file.
